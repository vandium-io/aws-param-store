## 4.2.0 (2017-07-17)

Updated:

* JWT for API Gateway now removes 'Bearer' prefix. Thanks @RobBrazier


## 4.1.0 (2017-05-18)

Updated:

* JWT: Public key with or without armor will be parsed and reformatted to make it easier to use the RS256 algorithm

Fix:

* Joi validation provider was pre-loading the library which cause compatibility issues with new version of Joi


## 4.0.0 (2017-05-05)

New:

* Event-based handler framework
* API Gateway handler mechanism to simplify lambda-proxy implementations
* Targeted validation, JWT enforcement and injection protection

Removed:

* Legacy wrapper for lambda functions
* Generalized validation, JWT and injection protection

Updated:

* Re-wrote most of the library
* Changed to work better with Node 6.1.x LTS


## 3.3.0 (2016-11-30)

New:

* `vandium.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop( true | false )` configuration option to prevent callbacks for waiting for empty event loops
* `callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` configuration option to `Vandium.configure()` to prevent callbacks for waiting for empty event loops
* `lambdaProxy` configuration option for AWS API Gateway lambda proxy support

Updated:

* Better error handling for AWS API Gateway including status codes for standard Vandium errors

Internal:

* Tests no longer use `lambda-tester` to reduce possibility of future circular dependency
* Changed `node-uuid` package to use new `uuid` one as per author's request


## 3.2.0 (2016-09-23)

New:

* `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` is now supported

Internal:

* Removed `codecov` module from build process

## 3.1.0 (2016-08-17)

New:

* Added `stringifyErrors` configuration property to improve error handling with AWS API Gateway

Updated:

* Configurations loaded from AWS S3 are now merged with the existing one

Internal:

* Changed callbacks to use ES2015 arrow functions


## 3.0.0 (2016-08-04)

New:

* Vandium instances can now be created programmatically via a builder pattern for integration into frameworks
* Configure all parameters via a main configuration function
* Integrates `joi-json` library to allow configuration of validation rules in both simple JSON and strings.
* Validator will ignore unknown events by default. Can be configured using the `allowUnknown` validation configuration property.
* Improved documentation
* New examples

Changed:

* Vandium singleton state gets reset after wrapping handler with `vandium()`. No longer requires module to be unloaded when testing

Internal:

* Refactored all areas where state is preserved. Not a problem for lambda but makes it easier to test on non-lambda environments

## 2.7.3 (2016-07-14)

Fixed:

* SQL injection attack detection for escape sequence with comments reporting false positive (issue #8)

## 2.7.2 (2016-07-08)

Updated:

* Changed how internal pipeline is created and thus preventing exceptions where `vandium()` is called more than once.

## 2.7.1 (2016-06-27)

New:

* Exceptions that get routed to `callback()` or `context.fail()` will get all properties, other than `err.message`, stripped
to hide details of underlying code. This can be disabled by calling `vandium.stripErrors( false )`.

## 2.6.1 (2016-06-22)

* Environment variable support to enable/disable injection attack protection

Improved:

* Documentation split into several markdown files inside the `docs` folder
